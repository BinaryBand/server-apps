# Backup Pipeline: Bidirectional BackupStage Port + Compress-Then-Sync Strategy

## Overview

The backup system uses a **ports & adapters** architecture where every backup strategy
implements the `BackupStage` protocol — a bidirectional contract with `backup()` and
`restore()` methods. This makes every strategy fully reversible and swappable.

### Pipeline symmetry

```text
BACKUP:   gather → restic  |  stream (source → cloud)  |  compress (zip → cloud)
RESTORE:  restic → volumes |  stream (cloud → source)  |  compress (cloud → unzip → source)
```

---

## Port: `BackupStage`

**File:** `src/ports/backup_stage.py`

```python
from typing import Protocol

class BackupStage(Protocol):
    """Port: a reversible backup/restore operation."""
    def backup(self) -> None: ...
    def restore(self) -> None: ...
```

All adapters satisfy this protocol. The orchestrators depend only on this port.

---

## Adapters

### `RcloneStreamSync` — `src/adapters/rclone/stream_sync.py`

Streams files directly between two rclone remotes (or local volume paths) without local staging.

- `backup()`: `rclone sync source → destination`
- `restore()`: `rclone sync destination → source` (direction swapped, excludes preserved)

Runs rclone in a disposable Docker container. Mounts all logical volumes at
`/data/volumes/<name>` and joins the compose network so `minio:9000` is reachable.

### `CompressStage` — `src/adapters/rclone/compress_stage.py`

Groups matched files by their immediate parent directory, zips each group, and uploads
the archives to a cloud remote. The archive path encodes the restore destination — no
separate manifest is needed.

- `backup()`:
  1. `rclone lsf source --include patterns` → file list
  2. Group by `PurePosixPath(f).parent`
  3. For each group: `rclone copy source/parent → /tmp/staging/parent`, zip it,
     `rclone copy archive → destination/grandparent/`

- `restore()`:
  1. `rclone lsf destination --include "**/*.zip"` → archive list
  2. For each archive: `rclone copy destination/archive_dir → /tmp/staging/`, unzip to
     `/tmp/extract/parent/`, `rclone copy /tmp/extract/parent → source/parent`

Uses a host temp directory bind-mounted into each disposable rclone container as staging.

## Stage Runner

**File:** `src/backup/stage_runner.py`

Generic dispatcher for any `BackupStage`:

```python
def run_backup_stage(stage: BackupStage, name: str) -> None: ...
def run_restore_stage(stage: BackupStage, name: str) -> None: ...
```

Replaces the old `stream_sync_stage()` function from `src/backup/stream_sync.py`.

---

## Configuration

**File:** `configs/backup.toml`

Three strategy sections:

```toml
[batch]
# Paths staged locally and snapshotted by restic (versioned, deduplicated).
include = [...]
exclude = [...]

[[stream]]
# Streamed directly source → cloud via rclone sync (no local staging).
name = "..."
source = "..."
destination = "..."
exclude = [...]   # optional

[[compress]]
# Files matching patterns are zipped per parent directory and uploaded.
name = "..."
source = "..."           # rclone remote, e.g. "minio:media/podcasts"
patterns = [...]         # rclone --include globs
destination = "..."      # archive landing zone, e.g. "pcloud:Backups/Compressed/podcasts"
```

Pydantic models (`BatchConfig`, `StreamSource`, `CompressSource`) enforce `extra="forbid"` —
unknown keys in the TOML raise a validation error at startup.

### Policy note: large-media (Jellyfin posters)

The example `configs/backup.toml` included with this repository intentionally
excludes Jellyfin poster/artwork from the batch staging and does not provide a
`jellyfin-metadata` `[[stream]]` entry by default. Rationale: artwork directories
contain a very large number of relatively small image files which greatly
increase upload and download times and can bloat cloud storage and snapshot
repositories. The project keeps small, critical items (databases, config) in
restic snapshots for versioning and integrity, streams large object stores (e.g.
MinIO) directly to cloud remotes, and compresses selected media where appropriate.

If you prefer to back up artwork, remove the `exclude` for
`volumes/jellyfin_data/metadata/**` and add a `[[stream]]` block or a
`[[compress]]` policy for targeting artwork archives.

### High-file-count buckets (example: minio:notebook)

Buckets containing very large numbers of small objects (for example
`minio:notebook`) can cause poor sync performance and high API overhead.
For these, prefer a `[[compress]]` entry that zips per-parent-directory and
uploads archives to a cloud remote. This reduces file count and improves
transfer reliability while still preserving content (see configs/backup.toml
for the `notebook-archives` example).

---

## Orchestrators

### `src/orchestrators/backup.py`

Runs stages in order: gather → restic → stream × N → compress × N.
Each stage is wrapped in `run_checkpoint_stage` for resumability.

### `src/orchestrators/restore.py`

Runs stages in order: restic restore → stream × N (reversed) → compress × N (reversed).
Loads `BackupConfig` from `backup.toml` to drive the stream and compress stages.
